# # Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SCBO)
# In this tutorial, we show how to implement Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SCBO) [1] in a closed loop in BoTorch.
# 
# We optimize the 20ùê∑ Ackley function on the domain $[‚àí5,10]^{20}$. This implementation uses two simple constraint functions $c1$ and $c2$. Our goal is to find values $x$ which maximizes $Ackley(x)$ subject to the constraints $c1(x) \leq 0$ and $c2(x) \leq 0$.

# (https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2002.08526)
# 
# Since SCBO is essentially a constrained version of Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (TuRBO), this tutorial shares much of the same code as the TuRBO Tutorial (https://botorch.org/tutorials/turbo_1) with small modifications made to implement SCBO.

# ## Demonstration with 20-dimensional Ackley function and Two Simple Constraint Functions

# Here we define the example 20D Ackley function

batch_size = 4
n_init = 2 * dim

# When evaluating the function, we must first unnormalize the inputs since
# we will use normalized inputs x in the main optimizaiton loop
def eval_objective(x):
    """This is a helper function we use to unnormalize and evalaute a point"""
    return fun(unnormalize(x, fun.bounds))


# ### Defining two simple constraint functions
# 
# #### We'll use two constraints functions: c1 and c2 
# We want to find solutions which maximize the above Ackley objective subject to the constraint that 
# c1(x) <= 0 and c2(x) <= 0 
# Note that SCBO expects all constraints to be of the for c(x) <= 0, so any other desired constraints must be modified to fit this form. 
# 
# Note also that while the below constraints are very simple functions, the point of this tutorial is to show how to use SCBO, and this same implementation could be applied in the same way if c1, c2 were actually complex black-box functions. 
# 

# In[3]:


def c1(x):  # Equivalent to enforcing that x[0] >= 0
    return -x[0]


def c2(x):  # Equivalent to enforcing that x[1] >= 0
    return -x[1]


# We assume c1, c2 have same bounds as the Ackley function above

# ## Define TuRBO Class
# 
# Just as in the TuRBO Tutorial (https://botorch.org/tutorials/turbo_1), we'll define a class to hold the turst region state and a method update_state() to update the side length of the trust region hyper-cube during optimization. We'll update the side length according to the number of sequential successes or failures as discussed in the original TuRBO paper.

    Success and failure counters are updated according to the objective values

    evaluated on the optimization step.

    As in the original TuRBO paper, a success is counted whenver any one of the 
    new candidate points improves upon the incumbent best point. The key difference 
    for SCBO is that we only compare points by their objective values when both points
    are valid (meet all constraints). If exactly one of the two points being compared 
    violates a constraint, the other valid point is automatically considered to be better. 
    If both points violate some constraints, we compare them inated by their constraint values.

# ### Generating a batch of candidates for SCBO 
# 
# Just as in the TuRBO Tutorial (https://botorch.org/tutorials/turbo_1), we'll define a method generate_batch to generate a new batch of candidate points within the TuRBO trust region using Thompson sampling. 
# 
# The key difference here from TuRBO is that, instead of using MaxPosteriorSampling to simply grab the candidates within the trust region with the maximum posterior values, we use ConstrainedMaxPosteriorSampling to instead grab the candidates within the trust region with the maximum posterior values subject to the constraint that the posteriors for the constraint models for c1(x) and c2(x) must be less than or equal to 0 for both candidates. 
# 
# We use additional GPs ('constraint models') to model each black-box constraint (c1 and c2), and throw out all candidates for which the sampled value for these constraint models is greater than 0. According to [1], in the special case when all of the candidaates are predicted to be constraint violators, we select the candidate with the minimum predicted violation. (See botorch.generation.sampling.ConstrainedMaxPosteriorSampling for implementation details).
